      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      My name is Johan Edvardsson. I'm 22 years old and I live in a small town
      outside of Gothenburg. My favourite season of the year is Winter because I
      enjoy the cold and dark, it's cozy!

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
      The most important part of my daily life must be music. I listen to music
      almost from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. While I'm not
      listening to music I'm either thinking about it or playing it myself on my
      7 string guitar! I mostly listen to heavy metal and all of its subgenres
      but I enjoy most types of music.
