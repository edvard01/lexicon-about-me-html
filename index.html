      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      My name is Johan Edvardsson. I'm 22 years old and I live in a small town
      outside of Gothenburg. My favourite season of the year is Winter because I
      enjoy the cold and dark, it's cozy!

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
      The most important part of my daily life must be music. I listen to music
      almost from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. While I'm not
      listening to music I'm either thinking about it or playing it myself on my
      7 string guitar! I mostly listen to heavy metal and all of its subgenres
      but I enjoy most types of music.

    <p>Here is a list of some of my favourite bands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Angelmaker</li>
      <li>Vildhjarta</li>
      <li>Make Them Suffer</li>
      <li>Ice Nine Kills</li>
      <li>Wage War</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Videogames</h3>
    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy playing online games. I keep in touch with and
      hang out with a lot of my friends this way. The genres I enjoy the most
      are competetive games, this can be both FPS games and MOBA games, as well
      as MMORPG games. Most of my time playing games currently I spend on either
      World of Warcraft, DotA 2 or CS2.
